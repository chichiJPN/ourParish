Responsorial Psalm 	JDT 13:18BCDE, 19

Blessed are you, daughter, by the Most High God,
above all the women on earth;
and blessed be the LORD God, 
the creator of heaven and earth.

Your deed of hope will never be forgotten
by those who tell of the might of God.
R. You are the highest honor of our race
