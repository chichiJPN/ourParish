Responsorial Psalm PS 119:1-2, 4-5, 7-8

R. (1b) Blessed are they who follow the law of the Lord!

Blessed are they whose way is blameless,

who walk in the law of the LORD.

Blessed are they who observe his decrees,

who seek him with all their heart.

R. Blessed are they who follow the law of the Lord!

You have commanded that your precepts

be diligently kept.

Oh, that I might be firm in the ways

of keeping your statutes!

R. Blessed are they who follow the law of the Lord!

I will give you thanks with an upright heart,

when I have learned your just ordinances.

I will keep your statutes;

do not utterly forsake me.

R. Blessed are they who follow the law of the Lord!
