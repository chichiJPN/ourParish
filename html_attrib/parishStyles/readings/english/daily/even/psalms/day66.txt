Responsorial Psalm 	PS 119:9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

R. (12b) Lord, teach me your statutes.

How shall a young man be faultless in his way?

By keeping to your words.

R. Lord, teach me your statutes.

With all my heart I seek you;

let me not stray from your commands.

R. Lord, teach me your statutes.

Within my heart I treasure your promise,

that I may not sin against you.

R. Lord, teach me your statutes.

Blessed are you, O LORD;

teach me your statutes.

R. Lord, teach me your statutes.

With my lips I declare

all the ordinances of your mouth. 

R. Lord, teach me your statutes.

In the way of your decrees I rejoice,

as much as in all riches.

R. Lord, teach me your statutes.
