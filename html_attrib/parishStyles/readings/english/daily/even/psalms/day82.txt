Responsorial Psalm PS 49:14-15AB, 15CD-16, 17-18, 19-20

R. (Matthew 5:3) Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!

This is the way of those whose trust is folly,

the end of those contented with their lot:

Like sheep they are herded into the nether world;

death is their shepherd and the upright rule over them.

R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!

Quickly their form is consumed;

the nether world is their palace.

But God will redeem me

from the power of the nether world by receiving me.

R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!

Fear not when a man grows rich,

when the wealth of his house becomes great,

For when he dies, he shall take none of it;

his wealth shall not follow him down.

R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!

Though in his lifetime he counted himself blessed,

“They will praise you for doing well for yourself,”

He shall join the circle of his forebears

who shall never more see light.

R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!
