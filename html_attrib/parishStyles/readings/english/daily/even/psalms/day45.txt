Responsorial Psalm	 PS 21:2-3, 4-5, 6-7

R. (2a) Lord, in your strength the king is glad.

O LORD, in your strength the king is glad;

in your victory how greatly he rejoices!

You have granted him his heart’s desire;

you refused not the wish of his lips.

R. Lord, in your strength the king is glad.

For you welcomed him with goodly blessings,

you placed on his head a crown of pure gold.

He asked life of you: you gave him

length of days forever and ever.

R. Lord, in your strength the king is glad.

Great is his glory in your victory;

majesty and splendor you conferred upon him.

For you made him a blessing forever;

you gladdened him with the joy of your face.

R. Lord, in your strength the king is glad.
