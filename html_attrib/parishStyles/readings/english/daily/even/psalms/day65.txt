Responsorial Psalm	 PS 18:31, 47 AND 50, 51

R. (see 47b) Blessed be God my salvation!

God’s way is unerring,

the promise of the LORD is fire-tried;

he is a shield to all who take refuge in him.

R. Blessed be God my salvation!

The LORD live! And blessed be my Rock!

Extolled be God my savior.

Therefore will I proclaim you, O LORD, among the nations,

and I will sing praise to your name.

R. Blessed be God my salvation!

You who gave great victories to your king

and showed kindness to your anointed,

to David and his posterity forever.

R. Blessed be God my salvation!
