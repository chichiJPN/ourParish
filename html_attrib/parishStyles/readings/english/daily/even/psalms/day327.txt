Responsorial Psalm PS 84:3, 4, 5-6A AND 8A

R. (Rev. 21:3b) Here God lives among his people.

My soul yearns and pines 

for the courts of the LORD.

My heart and my flesh

cry out for the living God.

R. Here God lives among his people.

Even the sparrow finds a home,

and the swallow a nest

in which she puts her young–

Your altars, O LORD of hosts,

my king and my God!

R. Here God lives among his people.

Blessed they who dwell in your house!

continually they praise you.

Blessed the men whose strength you are!

They go from strength to strength.

R. Here God lives among his people.
