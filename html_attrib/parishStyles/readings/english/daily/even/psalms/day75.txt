Responsorial Psalm PS 15:2-3A, 3AB-4AB, 5

R. (1b) Who shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord?

He who walks blamelessly and does justice;

who thinks the truth in his heart

and slanders not with his tongue. 

R. Who shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord?

Who harms not his fellow man,

nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;

By whom the reprobate is despised,

while he honors those who fear the LORD. 

R. Who shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord?

Who lends not his money at usury

and accepts no bribe against the innocent.

He who does these things

shall never be disturbed. 

R. Who shall live on your holy mountain, O Lord?
