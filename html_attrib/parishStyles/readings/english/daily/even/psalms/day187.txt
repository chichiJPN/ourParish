Responsorial Psalm 

R. (9) For the glory of your name, O Lord, deliver us.

O God, the nations have come into your inheritance;

they have defiled your holy temple,

they have laid Jerusalem in ruins.

They have given the corpses of your servants

as food to the birds of heaven,

the flesh of your faithful ones to the beasts of the earth.

R. For the glory of your name, O Lord, deliver us.

They have poured out their blood like water

round about Jerusalem,

and there is no one to bury them.

We have become the reproach of our neighbors,

the scorn and derision of those around us.

O LORD, how long? Will you be angry forever?

Will your jealousy burn like fire?

R. For the glory of your name, O Lord, deliver us.

Remember not against us the iniquities of the past;

may your compassion quickly come to us,

for we are brought very low.

R. For the glory of your name, O Lord, deliver us.

Help us, O God our savior,

because of the glory of your name;

Deliver us and pardon our sins

for your name’s sake. 

R. For the glory of your name, O Lord, deliver us.
