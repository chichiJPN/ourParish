Responsorial Psalm PS 78:56-57, 58-59, 61-62

R. (see 7b) Do not forget the works of the Lord!

They tempted and rebelled against God the Most High,

and kept not his decrees.

They turned back and were faithless like their fathers;

they recoiled like a treacherous bow.

R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!

They angered him with their high places

and with their idols roused his jealousy.

God heard and was enraged

and utterly rejected Israel.

R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!

And he surrendered his strength into captivity,

his glory in the hands of the foe.

He abandoned his people to the sword

and was enraged against his inheritance.

R. Do not forget the works of the Lord!
