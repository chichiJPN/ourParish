Responsorial Psalm 	PS 132:6-7, 8-10

R. (8a) Lord, go up to the place of your rest!

Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah;

we found it in the fields of Jaar.

Let us enter into his dwelling,

let us worship at his footstool.

R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest!

Advance, O LORD, to your resting place,

you and the ark of your majesty.

May your priests be clothed with justice;

let your faithful ones shout merrily for joy.

For the sake of David your servant,

reject not the plea of your anointed.

R. Lord, go up to the place of your rest!
