Responsorial Psalm 	PS 72:1-2, 14 AND 15BC, 17

R. (see 11) Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.

O God, with your judgment endow the king,

and with your justice, the king’s son;

He shall govern your people with justice

and your afflicted ones with judgment.

R. Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.

From fraud and violence he shall redeem them,

and precious shall their blood be in his sight.

May they be prayed for continually;

day by day shall they bless him.

R. Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.

May his name be blessed forever;

as long as the sun his name shall remain.

In him shall all the tribes of the earth be blessed;

all the nations shall proclaim his happiness.

R. Lord, every nation on earth will adore you.
