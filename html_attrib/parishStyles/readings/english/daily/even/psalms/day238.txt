Responsorial Psalm PS 107:2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9

R. (1) Give thanks to the Lord; his love is everlasting.

Let the redeemed of the LORD say,

those whom he has redeemed from the hand of the foe

And gathered from the lands,

from the east and the west, from the north and the south.

R. Give thanks to the Lord; his love is everlasting.

They went astray in the desert wilderness; 

the way to an inhabited city they did not find.

Hungry and thirsty,

their life was wasting away within them.

R. Give thanks to the Lord; his love is everlasting.

They cried to the LORD in their distress;

from their straits he rescued them.

And he led them by a direct way

to reach an inhabited city.

R. Give thanks to the Lord; his love is everlasting.

Let them give thanks to the LORD for his mercy

and his wondrous deeds to the children of men,

Because he satisfied the longing soul

and filled the hungry soul with good things.

R. Give thanks to the Lord; his love is everlasting.
