Responsorial Psalm PS 5:4B-6A, 6B-7, 8

R. (9a) Lead me in your justice, Lord.

At dawn I bring my plea expectantly before you.

For you, O God, delight not in wickedness;

no evil man remains with you;

the arrogant may not stand in your sight.

R. Lead me in your justice, Lord.

You hate all evildoers;

you destroy all who speak falsehood;

The bloodthirsty and the deceitful

the LORD abhors.

R. Lead me in your justice, Lord.

But I, because of your abundant mercy,

will enter your house;

I will worship at your holy temple

in fear of you, O LORD.

R. Lead me in your justice, Lord.
