Bless the LORD, O my soul;

all my being, bless his holy name.

Bless the LORD, O my soul;

and forget not all his benefits.

He pardons all your iniquities,

heals all your ills.

He redeems your life from destruction,

crowns you with kindness and compassion.

Merciful and gracious is the LORD,

slow to anger and abounding in kindness.

nor does he requite us according to our crimes.
