I have sworn to David my servant:

I will make your dynasty stand forever

and establish your throne through all ages.”

“He shall cry to me, ‘You are my father,

my God, the Rock that brings me victory!’

I myself make him firstborn,

Most High over the kings of the earth.”

“Forever I will maintain my love for him;

my covenant with him stands firm.

I will establish his dynasty forever,

his throne as the days of the heavens.”
