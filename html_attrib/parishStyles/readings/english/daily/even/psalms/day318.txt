Responsorial Psalm PS 150:1B-2, 3-4, 5-6

R. (1b) Holy, holy, holy Lord, mighty God!

Praise the LORD in his sanctuary,

praise him in the firmament of his strength.

Praise him for his mighty deeds,

praise him for his sovereign majesty.

R. Holy, holy, holy Lord, mighty God!

Praise him with the blast of the trumpet,

praise him with lyre and harp,

Praise him with timbrel and dance,

praise him with strings and pipe.

R. Holy, holy, holy Lord, mighty God!

Praise him with sounding cymbals,

praise him with clanging cymbals.

Let everything that has breath

praise the LORD! Alleluia.

R. Holy, holy, holy Lord, mighty God!
