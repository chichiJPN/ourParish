Responsorial Psalm PS 119:67, 68, 71, 72, 75, 76

R. (77a) Be kind to me, Lord, and I shall live.

Before I was afflicted I went astray,

but now I hold to your promise. 

R. Be kind to me, Lord, and I shall live.

You are good and bountiful;

teach me your statutes. 

R. Be kind to me, Lord, and I shall live.

It is good for me that I have been afflicted,

that I may learn your statutes. 

R. Be kind to me, Lord, and I shall live.

The law of your mouth is to me more precious

than thousands of gold and silver pieces. 

R. Be kind to me, Lord, and I shall live.

I know, O LORD, that your ordinances are just,

and in your faithfulness you have afflicted me. 

R. Be kind to me, Lord, and I shall live.

Let your kindness comfort me

according to your promise to your servants. 

R. Be kind to me, Lord, and I shall live.
