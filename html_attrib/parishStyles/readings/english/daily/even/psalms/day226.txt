Responsorial Psalm DT 32:35CD-36AB, 39ABCD, 41

R. (39c) It is I who deal death and give life.

Close at hand is the day of their disaster,

and their doom is rushing upon them!

Surely, the LORD shall do justice for his people;

on his servants he shall have pity.

R. It is I who deal death and give life.

“Learn then that I, I alone, am God,

and there is no god besides me.

It is I who bring both death and life,

I who inflict wounds and heal them.”

R. It is I who deal death and give life.

I will sharpen my flashing sword,

and my hand shall lay hold of my quiver,

“With vengeance I will repay my foes

and requite those who hate me.”

R. It is I who deal death and give life.
