Responsorial Psalm PS 37:5-6, 30-31, 39-40

R. (30a) The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.

Commit to the LORD your way;

trust in him, and he will act.

He will make justice dawn for you like the light;

bright as the noonday shall be your vindication.

R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.

The mouth of the just man tells of wisdom

and his tongue utters what is right.

The law of his God is in his heart,

and his steps do not falter.

R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.

The salvation of the just is from the LORD;

he is their refuge in time of distress.

And the LORD helps them and delivers them;

he delivers them from the wicked and saves them,

because they take refuge in him.

R. The mouth of the just murmurs wisdom.
