Responsorial Psalm PS 141:1-2, 3 AND 8

R. (2a) Let my prayer come like incense before you.

O LORD, to you I call; hasten to me;

hearken to my voice when I call upon you.

Let my prayer come like incense before you;

the lifting up of my hands, like the evening sacrifice.

R. Let my prayer come like incense before you.

O LORD, set a watch before my mouth,

a guard at the door of my lips.

For toward you, O God, my LORD, my eyes are turned;

in you I take refuge; strip me not of life.

R. Let my prayer come like incense before you.
