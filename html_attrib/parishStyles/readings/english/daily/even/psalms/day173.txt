Responsorial Psalm PS 65:10, 11, 12-13

R. (2a) It is right to praise you in Zion, O God.

You have visited the land and watered it;

greatly have you enriched it.

God’s watercourses are filled;

you have prepared the grain.

R. It is right to praise you in Zion, O God.

Thus have you prepared the land: 

drenching its furrows, breaking up its clods,

Softening it with showers, 

blessing its yield.

R. It is right to praise you in Zion, O God.

You have crowned the year with your bounty,

and your paths overflow with a rich harvest;

The untilled meadows overflow with it,

and rejoicing clothes the hills.

R. It is right to praise you in Zion, O God.
