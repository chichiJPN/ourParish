Responsorial Psalm	PS 56:2-3, 9-10A, 10B-11, 12-13

R. (5b) In God I trust; I shall not fear.

Have mercy on me, O God, for men trample upon me;

all the day they press their attack against me.

My adversaries trample upon me all the day;

yes, many fight against me.

R. In God I trust; I shall not fear.

My wanderings you have counted;

my tears are stored in your flask;

are they not recorded in your book?

Then do my enemies turn back,

when I call upon you.

R. In God I trust; I shall not fear.

Now I know that God is with me.

In God, in whose promise I glory,

in God I trust without fear;

what can flesh do against me?

R. In God I trust; I shall not fear.

I am bound, O God, by vows to you;

your thank offerings I will fulfill.

For you have rescued me from death,

my feet, too, from stumbling;

that I may walk before God in the light of the living.

R. In God I trust; I shall not fear.
