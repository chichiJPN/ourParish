R. (26a) I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.

they who seek the LORD shall praise him:

“May your hearts be ever merry!”

R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.

All the ends of the earth

shall remember and turn to the LORD;

All the families of the nations

shall bow down before him.

R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people. 

For dominion is the LORD’s,

and he rules the nations.

To him alone shall bow down

all who sleep in the earth.

R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.

To him my soul shall live;

my descendants shall serve him.

Let the coming generation be told of the LORD

that they may proclaim to a people yet to be born

the justice he has shown.

R. I will praise you, Lord, in the assembly of your people.
