Responsorial Psalm 	PS 89:20, 21-22, 25-26

R. (25a) My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him.

Once you spoke in a vision,

and to your faithful ones you said:

“On a champion I have placed a crown;

over the people I have set a youth.”

R. My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him.

“I have found David, my servant;

with my holy oil I have anointed him,

That my hand may be always with him,

and that my arm may make him strong.”

R. My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him.

“My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him,

and through my name shall his horn be exalted.

I will set his hand upon the sea,

his right hand upon the rivers.”

R. My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him.
