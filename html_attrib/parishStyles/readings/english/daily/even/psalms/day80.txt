Responsorial Psalm PS 55:7-8, 9-10A, 10B-11A, 23

And I say, “Had I but wings like a dove,

I would fly away and be at rest.

Far away I would flee;

I would lodge in the wilderness.”

R. Throw your cares on the Lord, and he will support you.

“I would wait for him who saves me

from the violent storm and the tempest.”

Engulf them, O Lord; divide their counsels. 

R. Throw your cares on the Lord, and he will support you.

In the city I see violence and strife,

day and night they prowl about upon its walls. 

R. Throw your cares on the Lord, and he will support you.

Cast your care upon the LORD,

and he will support you;

never will he permit the just man to be disturbed.
