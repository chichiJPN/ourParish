Responsorial Psalm	 PS 51:12-13, 14-15, 16-17

R. (12a) Create a clean heart in me, O God.

A clean heart create for me, O God,

and a steadfast spirit renew within me.

Cast me not out from your presence,

and your Holy Spirit take not from me.

R. Create a clean heart in me, O God.

Give me back the joy of your salvation,

and a willing spirit sustain in me.

I will teach transgressors your ways,

and sinners shall return to you.

R. Create a clean heart in me, O God.

Free me from blood guilt, O God, my saving God;

then my tongue shall revel in your justice.

O Lord, open my lips,

and my mouth shall proclaim your praise.

R. Create a clean heart in me, O God.
