Responsorial Psalm 	PS 3:2-3, 4-5, 6-7

R. (8a) Lord, rise up and save me.

O LORD, how many are my adversaries!

Many rise up against me!

Many are saying of me,

“There is no salvation for him in God.”

R. Lord, rise up and save me.

But you, O LORD, are my shield;

my glory, you lift up my head!

When I call out to the LORD,

he answers me from his holy mountain.

R. Lord, rise up and save me.

When I lie down in sleep,

I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.

I fear not the myriads of people

arrayed against me on every side.

R. Lord, rise up and save me.
