Responsorial Psalm PS 80:2AC AND 3B, 15-16

R. (4b) Let us see your face, Lord, and we shall be saved.

O shepherd of Israel, hearken.

From your throne upon the cherubim, shine forth.

Rouse your power.

R. Let us see your face, Lord, and we shall be saved.

Once again, O LORD of hosts,

look down from heaven, and see:

Take care of this vine,

and protect what your right hand has planted,

the son of man whom you yourself made strong. 

R. Let us see your face, Lord, and we shall be saved.
