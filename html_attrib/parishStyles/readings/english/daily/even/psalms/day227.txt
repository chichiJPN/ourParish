Responsorial Psalm PS 9:8-9, 10-11, 12-13

R. (11b) You forsake not those who seek you, O Lord.

The LORD sits enthroned forever;

he has set up his throne for judgment.

He judges the world with justice;

he governs the peoples with equity.

R. You forsake not those who seek you, O Lord.

The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed,

a stronghold in times of distress.

They trust in you who cherish your name,

for you forsake not those who seek you, O LORD.

R. You forsake not those who seek you, O Lord.

Sing praise to the LORD enthroned in Zion;

proclaim among the nations his deeds;

For the avenger of blood has remembered;

he has not forgotten the cry of the poor.

R. You forsake not those who seek you, O Lord.
