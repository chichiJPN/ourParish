Responsorial Psalm 	PS 132:1-2, 3-5, 11, 12, 13-14

R. (Lk 1:32b) The Lord God will give him the throne of David, his father.

LORD, remember David

and all his anxious care;

How he swore an oath to the LORD,

vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob.

R. The Lord God will give him the throne of David, his father.

“I will not enter the house where I live,

nor lie on the couch where I sleep;

I will give my eyes no sleep,

my eyelids no rest,

Till I find a home for the LORD,

a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”

R. The Lord God will give him the throne of David, his father.

The LORD swore an oath to David

a firm promise from which he will not withdraw:

“Your own offspring 

I will set upon your throne.”

R. The Lord God will give him the throne of David, his father.

“If your sons keep my covenant,

and the decrees which I shall teach them,

Their sons, too, forever

shall sit upon your throne.”

R. The Lord God will give him the throne of David, his father.

For the LORD has chosen Zion,

he prefers her for his dwelling:

“Zion is my resting place forever;

in her I will dwell, for I prefer her.”

R. The Lord God will give him the throne of David, his father.
