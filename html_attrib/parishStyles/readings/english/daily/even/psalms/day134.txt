Responsorial Psalm PS 2:1-3, 4-7A, 7B-9

R. (see 11d) Blessed are all who take refuge in the Lord.

or:

R. Alleluia.

Why do the nations rage

and the peoples utter folly?

The kings of the earth rise up,

and the princes conspire together

against the LORD and against his anointed:

“Let us break their fetters

and cast their bonds from us!”

R. Blessed are all who take refuge in the Lord.

or:

R. Alleluia.

He who is throned in heaven laughs;

the LORD derides them.

Then in anger he speaks to them;

he terrifies them in his wrath:

“I myself have set up my king

on Zion, my holy mountain.”

I will proclaim the decree of the LORD.

R. Blessed are all who take refuge in the Lord.

or:

R. Alleluia.

The LORD said to me, “You are my Son;

this day I have begotten you.

Ask of me and I will give you

the nations for an inheritance

and the ends of the earth for your possession.

You shall rule them with an iron rod;

you shall shatter them like an earthen dish.”

R. Blessed are all who take refuge in the Lord.

or:

R. Alleluia.
