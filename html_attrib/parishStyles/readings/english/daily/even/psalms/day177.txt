Responsorial Psalm PS 5:2-3AB, 4B-6A, 6B-7

R. (2b) Lord, listen to my groaning.

Hearken to my words, O LORD,

attend to my sighing.

Heed my call for help,

my king and my God!

R. Lord, listen to my groaning.

At dawn I bring my plea expectantly before you.

For you, O God, delight not in wickedness;

no evil man remains with you;

the arrogant may not stand in your sight. 

R. Lord, listen to my groaning.

You hate all evildoers.

You destroy all who speak falsehood;

The bloodthirsty and the deceitful

the LORD abhors.

R. Lord, listen to my groaning.
