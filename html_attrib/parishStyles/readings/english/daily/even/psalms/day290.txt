Responsorial Psalm PS 100:1B-2, 3, 4AB, 4C-5

R. (3b) The Lord made us, we belong to him.

Sing joyfully to the LORD all you lands;

serve the LORD with gladness;

come before him with joyful song.

R. The Lord made us, we belong to him.

Know that the LORD is God;

he made us, his we are;

his people, the flock he tends.

R. The Lord made us, we belong to him.

Enter his gates with thanksgiving,

his courts with praise.

R. The Lord made us, we belong to him.

Give thanks to him; bless his name, for he is good:

the LORD, whose kindness endures forever,

and his faithfulness, to all generations.

R. The Lord made us, we belong to him.
