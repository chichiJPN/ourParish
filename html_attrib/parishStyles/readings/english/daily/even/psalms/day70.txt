Responsorial Psalm PS 106:3-4, 35-36, 37 AND 40

R. (4a) Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.

Blessed are they who observe what is right,

who do always what is just.

Remember us, O LORD, as you favor your people;

visit us with your saving help. 

R. Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.

But they mingled with the nations

and learned their works.

They served their idols,

which became a snare for them. 

R. Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.

They sacrificed their sons

and their daughters to demons.

And the LORD grew angry with his people,

and abhorred his inheritance. 

R. Remember us, O Lord, as you favor your people.
