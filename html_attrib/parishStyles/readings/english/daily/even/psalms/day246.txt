Your command has made me wiser than my enemies,

for it is ever with me.

I have more understanding than all my teachers

when your decrees are my meditation.

I have more discernment than the elders,

because I observe your precepts.

From every evil way I withhold my feet,

that I may keep your words.

From your ordinances I turn not away,

for you have instructed me.

R. Lord, I love your commands.
