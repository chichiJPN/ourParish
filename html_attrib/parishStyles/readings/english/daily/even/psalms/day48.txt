Responsorial Psalm 	PS 89:20, 21-22, 27-28

R. (21a) I have found David, my servant.

Once you spoke in a vision,

and to your faithful ones you said:

“On a champion I have placed a crown;

over the people I have set a youth.”

R. I have found David, my servant.

“I have found David, my servant;

with my holy oil I have anointed him,

That my hand may be always with him,

and that my arm may make him strong.”

R. I have found David, my servant.

“He shall say of me, ‘You are my father,

my God, the Rock, my savior.’

And I will make him the first-born,

highest of the kings of the earth.”

R. I have found David, my servant.
