Responsorial Psalm 	PS 98:1, 7-8, 9

R. (3cd) All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.

Sing to the LORD a new song,

for he has done wondrous deeds;

His right hand has won victory for him,

his holy arm.

R. All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.

Let the sea and what fills it resound,

the world and those who dwell in it;

Let the rivers clap their hands,

the mountains shout with them for joy before the LORD.

R. All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.

The LORD comes;

he comes to rule the earth;

He will rule the world with justice

and the peoples with equity.

R. All the ends of the earth have seen the saving power of God.
