Responsorial Psalm DT 32:18-19, 20-21

R. (see 18a) You have forgotten God who gave you birth.

You were unmindful of the Rock that begot you.

You forgot the God who gave you birth.

When the LORD saw this, he was filled with loathing

and anger toward his sons and daughters.

R. You have forgotten God who gave you birth.

“I will hide my face from them,” he said,

“and see what will then become of them.

What a fickle race they are,

sons with no loyalty in them!”

R. You have forgotten God who gave you birth.

“Since they have provoked me with their ‘no-god’

and angered me with their vain idols,

I will provoke them with a ‘no-people’;

with a foolish nation I will anger them.”

R. You have forgotten God who gave you birth.
