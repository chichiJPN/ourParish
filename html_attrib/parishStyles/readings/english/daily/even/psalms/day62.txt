Responsorial Psalm 	PS 86:1-2, 3-4, 5-6

R. (1a) Listen, Lord, and answer me.

Incline your ear, O LORD; answer me,

for I am afflicted and poor.

Keep my life, for I am devoted to you;

save your servant who trusts in you. 

You are my God.

R. Listen, Lord, and answer me.

Have mercy on me, O Lord,

for to you I call all the day.

Gladden the soul of your servant,

for to you, O Lord, I lift up my soul.

R. Listen, Lord, and answer me.

For you, O Lord, are good and forgiving,

abounding in kindness to all who call upon you.

Hearken, O LORD, to my prayer

and attend to the sound of my pleading.

R. Listen, Lord, and answer me.
