Responsorial Psalm PS 132:11, 12, 13-14, 17-18

R. (13) The Lord has chosen Zion for his dwelling.

The LORD swore to David

a firm promise from which he will not withdraw:

“Your own offspring

I will set upon your throne.”

R. The Lord has chosen Zion for his dwelling.

“If your sons keep my covenant

and the decrees which I shall teach them,

Their sons, too, forever

shall sit upon your throne.”

R. The Lord has chosen Zion for his dwelling.

For the LORD has chosen Zion;

he prefers her for his dwelling.

“Zion is my resting place forever;

in her will I dwell, for I prefer her.”

R. The Lord has chosen Zion for his dwelling.

“In her will I make a horn to sprout forth for David;

I will place a lamp for my anointed.

His enemies I will clothe with shame,

but upon him my crown shall shine.”

R. The Lord has chosen Zion for his dwelling.
