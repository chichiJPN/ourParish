Responsorial Psalm PS 15:2-3A, 3BC-4AB, 5

R. (Rev. 3: 21) I will seat the victor beside me on my throne.

He who walks blamelessly and does justice;

who thinks the truth in his heart

and slanders not with his tongue.

R. I will seat the victor beside me on my throne.

Who harms not his fellow man,

nor takes up a reproach against his neighbor;

By whom the reprobate is despised,

while he honors those who fear the LORD.

R. I will seat the victor beside me on my throne.

Who lends not his money at usury

and accepts no bribe against the innocent.

He who does these things

shall never be disturbed.

R. I will seat the victor beside me on my throne.
