Responsorial Psalm PS 85:9AB AND 10, 11-12, 13-14

R. (see 10b) The glory of the Lord will dwell in our land.

I will hear what God proclaims;

the LORD –for he proclaims peace.

Near indeed is his salvation to those who fear him,

glory dwelling in our land.

R. The glory of the Lord will dwell in our land.

Kindness and truth shall meet;

justice and peace shall kiss.

Truth shall spring out of the earth,

and justice shall look down from heaven.

R. The glory of the Lord will dwell in our land.

The LORD himself will give his benefits;

our land shall yield its increase.

Justice shall walk before him, 

and salvation, along the way of his steps. 

R. The glory of the Lord will dwell in our land.
