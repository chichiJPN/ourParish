Responsorial Psalm PS 49:2-3, 6-7, 8-10, 11

R. (Matthew 5:3) Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!

Hear this, all you peoples;

hearken, all who dwell in the world,

Of lowly birth or high degree,

rich and poor alike.

R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!

Why should I fear in evil days

when my wicked ensnarers ring me round?

They trust in their wealth;

the abundance of their riches is their boast.

R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!

Yet in no way can a man redeem himself,

or pay his own ransom to God;

Too high is the price to redeem one’s life; he would never have enough

to remain alive always and not see destruction.

R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!

For he can see that wise men die,

and likewise the senseless and the stupid pass away,

leaving to others their wealth.

R. Blessed are the poor in spirit; the Kingdom of heaven is theirs!
