Responsorial Psalm DT 32:26-27AB, 27CD-28, 30, 35CD-36AB

R. (39c) It is I who deal death and give life.

“I would have said, ‘I will make an end of them

and blot out their name from men’s memories,’

Had I not feared the insolence of their enemies,

feared that these foes would mistakenly boast.”

R. It is I who deal death and give life.

“‘Our own hand won the victory;

the LORD had nothing to do with it.’”

For they are a people devoid of reason,

having no understanding.

R. It is I who deal death and give life.

“How could one man rout a thousand,

or two men put ten thousand to flight,

Unless it was because their Rock sold them

and the LORD delivered them up?”

R. It is I who deal death and give life.

Close at hand is the day of their disaster,

and their doom is rushing upon them!

Surely, the LORD shall do justice for his people;

on his servants he shall have pity.

R. It is I who deal death and give life.
