Responsorial Psalm PS 45:11-12, 14-15, 16-17

R. (11) Listen to me, daughter; see and bend your ear.

Hear, O daughter, and see; turn your ear,

forget your people and your father’s house.

So shall the king desire your beauty;

for he is your lord, and you must worship him.

R. Listen to me, daughter; see and bend your ear.

All glorious is the king’s daughter as she enters;

her raiment is threaded with spun gold.

In embroidered apparel she is borne in to the king;

behind her the virgins of her train are brought to you.

R. Listen to me, daughter; see and bend your ear.

They are borne in with gladness and joy;

they enter the palace of the king.

The place of your fathers your sons shall have;

you shall make them princes through all the land.

R. Listen to me, daughter; see and bend your ear.
