Responsorial Psalm PS 10:1B-2, 3, 4, 5

R. (3) We are his people: the sheep of his flock.

Sing joyfully to the LORD, all you lands;

serve the LORD with gladness;

come before him with joyful song.

R. We are his people: the sheep of his flock.

Know that the LORD is God;

he made us, his we are;

his people, the flock he tends.

R. We are his people: the sheep of his flock.

Enter his gates with thanksgiving,

his courts with praise;

Give thanks to him; bless his name.

R. We are his people: the sheep of his flock.

For he is good, the LORD, whose kindness endures forever,

and his faithfulness, to all generations. 

R. We are his people: the sheep of his flock.
