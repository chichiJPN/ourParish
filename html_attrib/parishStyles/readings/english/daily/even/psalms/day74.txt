Responsorial Psalm PS 94:12-13A, 14-15, 18-19

R. (12a) Blessed the man you instruct, O Lord.

Blessed the man whom you instruct, O LORD,

whom by your law you teach,

Giving him rest from evil days. 

R. Blessed the man you instruct, O Lord.

For the LORD will not cast off his people,

nor abandon his inheritance;

But judgment shall again be with justice,

and all the upright of heart shall follow it. 

R. Blessed the man you instruct, O Lord.

When I say, “My foot is slipping,”

your mercy, O LORD, sustains me;

When cares abound within me,

your comfort gladdens my soul. 

R. Blessed the man you instruct, O Lord.
