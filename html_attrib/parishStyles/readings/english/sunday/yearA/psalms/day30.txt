Reading 2	PHIL 1:20C-24, 27A

Brothers and sisters:

Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life or by death. 

For to me life is Christ, and death is gain. 

If I go on living in the flesh,

that means fruitful labor for me. 

And I do not know which I shall choose. 

I am caught between the two. 

I long to depart this life and be with Christ,

for that is far better. 

Yet that I remain in the flesh

is more necessary for your benefit.



Only, conduct yourselves in a way worthy of the gospel of Christ.
